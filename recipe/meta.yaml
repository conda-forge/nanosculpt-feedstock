  summary: 'nanoSCULPT is a tool to generate realistic configurations for Atomistic simulations'
  description: |
    nanoSCULPT was originally hosted at the individual development 
    groups of the tool, viz. FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg and Uni Stuttgart. 
    This repository now brings the efforts of the two groups into one 
    place.
